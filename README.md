# Huffman-coding-and-encoding
Huffman Coding for data encryption, compression and Decryption
Code to read values from a plain text file,
Perform huffman coding on the given data, and
Decode the cryptic code generated

The project is written in Java utilizing 4 way optimized heap. 

[1] encoder.java : used for encoding input
[2] decoder.java: used to decode the encoded input
[3] Readfile.java : Reads the input file passed by encoder.java
[4] HuffmanTree.java : Builds the huffman tree based on given input
[5] Main.java : Responsible for making frequency chart
[6] Fourwayoptimizedheap.java : four way heap implementation
[7] Node.java : Generates nodes in huffmant tree
[8] makefile: used for compiling all the files
